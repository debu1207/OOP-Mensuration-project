# OOP-Mensuration-project

This project is basically a practice exercise for object oriented programming in python.
But it can be helpful in some cases.
There are 3 python files, two of them for defining the classes for different 2D and 3D shapes.
One can easily modify the functions or add new function to the defined classes.
Then we have the test_shape.py python file to basically run the whole project on the terminal.
In which, you will be able to sea a menu to enter the type of shape either 2D or 3D and the 
other menu will appear about choosing the shape.
